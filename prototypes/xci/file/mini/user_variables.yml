# Typically this would be defined by the os-neutron-install
# playbook. The provider_networks library would parse the
# provider_networks list in openstack_user_config.yml and
# generate the values of network_types, network_vlan_ranges
# and network_mappings. network_mappings would have a
# different value for each host in the inventory based on
# whether or not the host was metal (typically a compute host)
# or a container (typically a neutron agent container)

# When using Open vSwitch, we override it to take into account
# the Open vSwitch bridge we are going to define outside of
# OpenStack-Ansible plays
